## Priority Order

1. **Phase 1 (Core Missing Features)**
   - URL story type
   - REPOST story type
   - UserTag following system

2. **Phase 2 (Engagement)**
   - Comments system
   - Credibility scores
   - Improved feeds

3. **Phase 3 (Safety & Polish)**
   - Reporting system
   - UI enhancements
   - Rich media support

The most critical missing piece is the **UserTag following system**, as this is the core differentiator of Tiiny - following interests rather than just people.

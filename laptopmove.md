# Project Setup on a New Machine

## Background and Motivation

The user has moved to a new laptop and needs to set up the existing project environment to continue development. This involves installing all necessary dependencies, resolving existing repository issues, and ensuring the project can run successfully.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1.  **Git Merge Conflicts:** The `git status` shows that the local `main` branch has diverged from `origin/main` and there are active merge conflicts. This is the most critical issue to resolve before we can proceed with dependency installation. The conflicting files are `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `app/debug/performance/page.tsx`, `app/home/stress-test/page.tsx`, and `supabase/functions/send-message/index.ts`. Resolving conflicts in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` must be done carefully to ensure all required dependencies from both branches are preserved.
2.  **Dependency Installation:** The project uses `npm`. Once git conflicts are resolved, we'll need to run `npm install`.
3.  **Supabase Setup:** The project uses Supabase. After installing dependencies, we'll need to ensure the Supabase environment is set up correctly, which may involve the Supabase CLI and database migrations.
4.  **Environment Variables:** A new setup requires a `.env.local` file with necessary secrets and configuration. We'll need to identify the required variables and create a template for the user.

## High-level Task Breakdown

This is the proposed plan to set up the project. Each step will be executed one at a time, with user verification.

### Phase 1: Resolve Git Conflicts

1.  **Analyze conflicts in `package.json`:** Read `package.json` to understand the conflicting changes.
    *   **Success Criteria:** I can explain the differences between the local and remote versions of the file.
2.  **Propose resolution for `package.json`:** Suggest a merged version of `package.json`. A common strategy is to re-run `npm install` for specific new dependencies after merging.
    *   **Success Criteria:** The user approves the proposed changes to `package.json`.
3.  **Resolve `package.json` and `package-lock.json`:** Apply the approved changes. I'll likely remove `package-lock.json` and regenerate it with `npm install` after `package.json` is fixed.
    *   **Success Criteria:** `package.json` is merged, and `package-lock.json` is handled. `git status` shows these files are no longer conflicting.
4.  **Analyze and resolve conflicts in other files:** Read the other conflicting files (`app/debug/performance/page.tsx`, `app/home/stress-test/page.tsx`, `supabase/functions/send-message/index.ts`) and propose a merge strategy. Since they are "both added", we might need to decide if we keep both with different names or merge their contents into one.
    *   **Success Criteria:** All remaining file conflicts are resolved. `git status` shows a clean merge.
5.  **Commit the merge:** Once all conflicts are resolved, commit the merge.
    *   **Success Criteria:** `git commit` succeeds and `git status` shows the working tree is clean and the merge is complete.

### Phase 2: Core Project Setup

1.  **Install Node.js dependencies:** Run `npm install`.
    *   **Success Criteria:** `npm install` completes without errors. A `node_modules` directory is created.
2.  **Inspect Tailwind CSS configuration:** Check `tailwind.config.ts`. This is mostly for my own understanding.
    *   **Success Criteria:** I understand how Tailwind is configured.

### Phase 3: Supabase Setup

1.  **Check for Supabase CLI:** The `package.json` file should tell us if it's a dev dependency. If not, I'll advise on installing it.
    *   **Success Criteria:** I know how the Supabase CLI is managed in this project.
2.  **Start Supabase services:** Run the command to start local Supabase services (e.g., `supabase start`).
    *   **Success Criteria:** Supabase docker containers are running and the local Supabase instance is accessible.

### Phase 4: Environment Configuration

1.  **Identify required environment variables:** Search the codebase for `process.env`.
    *   **Success Criteria:** I have a list of environment variables used in the project.
2.  **Create `.env.local` file:** Create a `.env.local` file with placeholder values for the user to fill in. I'll probably find the Supabase keys from the `supabase status` command output.
    *   **Success Criteria:** A `.env.local` file exists with the necessary variables.

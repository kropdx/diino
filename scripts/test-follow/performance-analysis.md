# Follow Functionality Performance Analysis

## Current Performance Results

### Feed Query Performance (kropdx's feed)

**Query Execution Time:** 0.318ms (Excellent! Well under our 100ms target)

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- Planning Time: 1.523ms
- Execution Time: 0.318ms  
- Total Time: ~1.84ms
- Rows Returned: 5
- All data served from cache (Shared Hit Blocks: 20, Read Blocks: 0)

### Query Plan Analysis

1. **Index Usage** ✅
   - Using `User_username_key` index for username lookup
   - Using `Follow_pkey` index for follow lookups
   - Using `CanonicalTag_pkey` index for tag lookups

2. **Join Strategy** ✅
   - Efficient nested loop and hash joins
   - Small dataset allows for in-memory operations

3. **Potential Issues** ⚠️
   - Sequential scan on Story table (but acceptable with current data size)
   - Sequential scan on User and UserTag tables

### Performance with Current Data

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Feed Query Time | 0.318ms | ✅ Excellent (target: <100ms) |
| Cache Hit Rate | 100% | ✅ Excellent |
| Index Usage | Partial | ⚠️ Good for now |

## Recommendations for Production Scale

### 1. Add Missing Indexes
```sql
-- Index for Story table feed queries
CREATE INDEX idx_story_author_created ON "Story"(author_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_story_usertag_created ON "Story"(user_tag_id, created_at DESC);

-- Index for Follow table queries
CREATE INDEX idx_follow_follower_channel ON "Follow"(follower_user_id, channel_type, channel_id);
```

### 2. Query Optimization
The current query uses OR conditions which can prevent index usage. Consider using UNION for better performance at scale:

```sql
-- Optimized feed query using UNION
(
  SELECT s.* FROM "Story" s 
  WHERE s.author_id = $1 -- user's own posts
  ORDER BY created_at DESC 
  LIMIT 50
)
UNION ALL
(
  SELECT s.* FROM "Story" s
  WHERE s.author_id IN (
    SELECT channel_id FROM "Follow" 
    WHERE follower_user_id = $1 AND channel_type = 'USER_ALL'
  )
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 50
)
UNION ALL
(
  SELECT s.* FROM "Story" s
  WHERE s.user_tag_id IN (
    SELECT channel_id FROM "Follow"
    WHERE follower_user_id = $1 AND channel_type = 'USER_TAG'
  )
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 50
)
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50
```

### 3. Scaling Considerations

**At 100 users with 100 stories each (10,000 stories):**
- Current query should still perform well (<50ms)
- Sequential scans will become problematic
- Indexes become critical

**At 10,000 users with 100 stories each (1M stories):**
- Need proper indexes on all filtered columns
- Consider materialized views for feed generation
- Implement pagination with cursor-based navigation
- Add caching layer (Redis) for frequently accessed feeds

### 4. Database Configuration
- Ensure `shared_buffers` is set appropriately (25% of RAM)
- Configure `effective_cache_size` (50-75% of RAM)
- Enable `pg_stat_statements` for query monitoring

## Testing at Scale

To properly test performance, we need more data:

1. Run `npm run test:follow:seed` to create 100 test users
2. Re-run performance tests with larger dataset
3. Monitor query plans as data grows
4. Test concurrent user scenarios

## Current Status Summary

✅ **Excellent performance** with current data (2 users, 5 stories)
✅ **Efficient query execution** with good cache usage
⚠️ **Limited test data** prevents realistic performance assessment
⚠️ **Missing indexes** that will be needed at scale

The follow functionality is performant for the current scale but needs the recommended optimizations before production deployment with thousands of users.

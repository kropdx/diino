# Diino Merge Plan  ðŸš§

## Background and Motivation
We are merging the real-time Stream Chat prototype (current repo) with the *Diino* social-story platform described in `diino.md`.  Goals:
1. Keep the single persistent Global Chat channel powered by Stream Chat.
2. Introduce the Story/Tag data model (Supabase tables + RLS) so users can publish stories.
3. Whenever a story is published, the server injects a formatted *story message* into the Global Chat (via Stream server API).  Chat replies that reference that story are saved to the `Comment` table.
4. Gradually port legacy React components from the old codebase feature-by-feature.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- **Schema alignment** â€“ Translate `diino.md` Prisma-style schema into Supabase SQL, removing Clerk references, ensuring proper FK & RLS.
- **Event fan-out** â€“ Story â†’ Edge Function â†’ Stream message; also handle chat reply â†’ DB comment.
- **UI cohesion** â€“ Chat interface needs a card renderer identical to story layout elsewhere; legacy component import strategy.
- **Migration safety** â€“ Must rebuild dev DB from scratch; no prod data yet, so can iterate quickly.

## Scope Update After Reviewing old-code âœ¨
The `old-code/` directory contains the full Tiiny app (Next 15 + Prisma + Clerk). Key deltas vs current repo:
1. Extensive **React component library** (story cards, profile, sidebar, etc.) we can progressively port.
2. **Prisma ORM** layer & helper utilities.
3. Huge set of **API routes** hitting Prisma DB.
4. **Middleware & Auth** built around Supabase (already migrated) but still importing Prisma.

### Implications
- We will **remove Prisma** and migrate persistence to Supabase Postgres / SQL queries (or drizzle later).  Short-term we can keep Prisma types to speed porting but replace runtime.
- Clerk references already stripped; only legacy files in old-code referencing Prisma remain.
- UI components can largely be copied as-is; they import shadcn primitives which we already have.

## Revised High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1 â€“ Database & RLS (completed âœ…)
- [x] 1.1 Translate Tiiny schema to Supabase SQL (Tables listed in diino.md)
- [x] 1.2 Write migration `20250707000000_initial_diino.sql` under `supabase/migrations/`
- [x] 1.3 Add RLS policies per table (public read for stories, owner write, etc.)
- [ ] 1.4 Seed helper SQL to create `global-chat` channel via edge function *(moved to Phase 3*
- [x] 1.5 Verify locally with Supabase CLI & unit tests

### Phase 2 â€“ Remove Prisma Layer (pending)
- [x] 2.1 Delete `/old-code/src/lib/db.ts` and ORM usages (reference only)
- [ ] 2.2 Replace API route data access with Supabase JS / SQL-RPC calls
- [x] 2.3 Generate TypeScript types from Supabase and add to repo

### Phase 3 â€“ Edge Functions & Triggers (in_progress)
- [ ] 3.1 `story-to-chat` edge function + Postgres trigger AFTER INSERT ON "Story" *(active)*
- [ ] 3.2 `sync-stream-user` finalize (ensure idempotent)
- [ ] 3.3 `chat-reply-to-comment` edge function (stretch)

### Phase 4 â€“ API Routes Refactor
- [ ] 4.1 Port `stories` endpoints to Supabase (text/url/repost)
- [ ] 4.2 Port `user` endpoints (profile, tags) dropping Prisma patterns
- [ ] 4.3 Port `bookmark`, `upvote`, `follow` endpoints
- [ ] 4.4 Add `/api/chat/reply` that maps chat msg to comment (stretch)

### Phase 5 â€“ Front-end Integration
- [ ] 5.1 Wire Story composer toggle (chat vs story) â€“ modify `NaviBar`
- [ ] 5.2 Render story cards inside chat (CustomMessage renderer)
- [ ] 5.3 Port legacy pages sequentially: Home â†’ Profile â†’ Tag view â†’ Bookmarks â†’ Settings/Trash

### Phase 6 â€“ Cleanup & Tests
- [ ] 6.1 Remove unused legacy code / Clerk leftovers
- [ ] 6.2 Jest / Playwright tests for RLS & API routes
- [ ] 6.3 Lighthouse + perf pass

## Open Questions for User âœ…
1. **Prisma removal timeline** â€“ okay to drop Prisma entirely now, or keep until API refactor done?
2. **Edge function quotas** â€“ heavy event fan-out via Edge functions is acceptable?
3. **Imgix & Vercel Blob** â€“ still desired for URL favicons? (requires env `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMGIX_DOMAIN`)

*Please confirm or adjust priorities so I can start on Phase 1 migrations.*

## Project Status Board
- [x] Phase 1 â€“ DB & RLS *(completed)*
- [x] Phase 2 â€“ Remove Prisma Layer *(tsconfig exclude legacy build fix)*
- [ ] Phase 3 â€“ Edge Functions *(in_progress)*
- [ ] Phase 4 â€“ API Routes
- [ ] Phase 5 â€“ Front-end Integration
- [ ] Phase 6 â€“ Polish

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Starting Task **3.1**: Will create a Supabase Edge Function `story-to-chat` that listens for new rows in `Story`, formats a compact card payload, and sends a message to Stream Chat global channel via server SDK. Need to decide: use Net HTTP call from Postgres trigger vs. Realtime Webhook? Plan: Postgres trigger â†’ HTTP POST to edge function (like sync-stream-user). Acceptable? (Edge function quota fine per user.)
- Build errors resolved by excluding `old-code/**` from TS compilation. âœ…
- Ready to implement Task **3.1 story-to-chat**. Need confirmation on approach:
  â€¢ Use Postgres trigger AFTER INSERT ON "Story" that makes `http_post` to Edge Function `story-to-chat` (similar to `sync-stream-user`).
  â€¢ Edge Function will use Stream Chat server SDK to post a formatted story card into `global-chat` channel.
  â€¢ Alternative is Realtime webhook but that adds latency.

Please confirm triggerâ†’edge function approach is acceptable, and provide any payload/format requirements for the chat message.

## Lessons
*(collect recurring gotchas here)*

### Guidance from User (2025-07-07)
> We will **not** run any legacy code.  Use old-code only for reference.  Copy UI/UX primitives (layout, components).  Re-implement data access fresh against Supabase.  Work feature-by-feature, test each before next.

### Methodology Update
- Treat `old-code/src/components/**` as design library to cherry-pick.
- For each feature:
  1. Identify UI components needed (reuse/copy).
  2. Design fresh API route / Supabase queries.
  3. Implement + write minimal tests.
  4. Tick checkbox before moving on.
